# CaloryWebApp
is a user-friendly website that organizes food and drink products enabling users to easily view calorie counts. 

Frontend (React):
 - Implemented a Navigation Bar with a light/dark mode toggle.
 - Developed category pages with RESTful API requests to fetch items.
 - Created a real-time search function for dynamic results.

Backend (Java/Spring Boot/Hibernate):
 - Built RESTful APIs for data interaction between the frontend and database.
 - Used Spring Framework with dependency injection for modular code and Spring Boot for rapid deployment.
 - Employed Hibernate for ORM to simplify data access and JPA Repository for efficient CRUD operations.
